# FumbleNote

**FumbleNote** is a simple, experimental text editor for **MacOS** that includes a few quality-of-life features like autosave, dyslexic font support, and both light and dark modes.

## Features:
- Runs on **MacOS arm64**.
- Can be compiled from source for different architectures, but mileage may vary.
- **Autosave** feature to ensure your work is always saved.
- Includes a **dyslexic font** for easier reading.
- Supports **Light** and **Dark mode**.

## Installation

1. **Download** the latest version for your platform from the [Releases]([https://github.com/yourusername/FumbleNote/releases](https://github.com/abker0/FumbleNote/releases/tag/1.0)) page.
2. **Install** the downloaded app by opening the `.dmg` file (for MacOS).
3. **Launch** the app and start using it.

## Compilation From Source

If you want to compile it yourself:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   - `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you prefer Yarn).
3. Compile the app using **Electron Forge** by running:
   - `npm run make` (or `yarn make`).
4. Once the build process completes, you'll have the distributable ready for your desired platform.

**Note**: While the app is primarily designed for **MacOS arm64**, it can be compiled for other architectures. However, compatibility may vary and could require additional configuration.

## Disclaimer

This is **not** intended for professional use, nor is it designed for critical or important tasks. **FumbleNote** was just a random project I worked on a while ago, and I’m publishing it now for whatever reason. It’s more of an experiment and something fun to share.
